            <h2>Software Developer</h2>
            <p>I have always wanted to become a software developer. My goal is to create software that is simple and fun
                to use. Growing up, I was fan of video games and was interested in learning how they worked and how they
                were created. This curiousity helped me learn more about software development in programming classes
                I took in junior high, high school, and college.</p>
            <!-- More specific xperience with coding? My first experience with programming was in junior high, where I learned how to program Lego Mindstorm robots to use various sensors to accomplish tasks. Robotics, C++, Unity  -->

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I graduated BYU-I in April 2025 with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, emphasis in Design. I
                learned
                a lot about how to design and code programs of various sizes using the concepts of encapsulation,
                inheritance, and separation of concerns. I had the opportunity to be in leadership positions for many
                of my courses, and even was a team lead in class-wide projects during my last two semesters.
                his taught me a lot about leading others, and how to direct a group of programmers towards a common
                goal.</p>
